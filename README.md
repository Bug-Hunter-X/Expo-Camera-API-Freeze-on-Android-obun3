# Expo Camera API Freeze on Android

This repository demonstrates a bug in the Expo `Camera` API on Android where the camera preview can freeze or become unresponsive after a short period.  The issue appears to be related to resource management and may be more prominent when the app is in the background or under heavy load.

## Bug Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run the app on an Android device (the bug may be more easily reproduced on older or lower-powered devices).
4. Observe the camera preview. After some time, it may freeze.

## Solution

A possible solution involves optimizing resource usage and potentially using a different approach to camera management. The solution provided in `bugSolution.js` offers an alternative implementation that addresses this issue, though a definitive fix might require further investigation.
